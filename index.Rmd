```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(janitor)
```

## Assignment 4


```{r}
jail <- read_dta("37392-0001-Data.dta")

jail <- jail %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

glimpse(jail)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
